# Shisen-Game

Shisen is a highly modified version of the classic Chinese board game Mahjongg. The game consists of 36 different tile types, each appearing four times on the board. The total board size is 144 tiles, arranged in an 8x18 matrix.

The objective is to remove all tiles from the board by selecting matching pairs. A pair of identical tiles can be removed only if they can be connected by at most three straight lines. These lines must be either horizontal or vertical and cannot pass through other tiles. However, they can extend beyond the edge of the board by one tile length.

It is important to note that not all games are guaranteed to be solvable. Since each tile has two matching pairs, an incorrect selection may result in an unsolvable board.
